            <div class="fit"> <h2>Social Engineering</h2><br> <p>is an attack that is using the person controlling the device or computer to gain information about the user. An example could be a fake advertisment for a really cheap phone or something like it. The user then takes the bait, fills out a payment form, the person behind this attack will then might have access to your card information, name, where you live and other things you might have had to fill out.<br><br> Ransomware is also using a sort of social engineering which is called a trojan  attack where the file seems like the thing you wanted to download but its a program that encrypts your computer and asks for an ransom to unlock it again, they might also threathen to leak information that you dont want people to find out, to make it harder to trace the ransom they often use data currencies like Ukash and Bitcoin</p></div>
